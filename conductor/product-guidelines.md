# Product Guidelines

## Tone and Style
- **Professional & Efficient:** The application's UI and documentation should prioritize conciseness, clarity, and developer productivity. Language should be direct and focused on assisting users in completing their tasks as quickly and effectively as possible.

## Visual Communication
- **Subtle & Integrated:** Use minimal and purposeful visual cues, such as small icons or subtle color changes, to communicate status and actions. The goal is to maintain a modern, clean UI that provides information without overwhelming the user or cluttering the workspace.

## Error Handling and Feedback
- **Self-Correction & Guidance:** The application should proactively attempt to self-correct common issues, particularly regarding environment setup and configuration. When user intervention is required, provide clear, actionable steps to resolve the problem, minimizing technical jargon and focusing on the path to success.
